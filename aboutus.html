        <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">About Me:</h3>
        <p>I am Vaibhav, 20 years old. I am passionate about learning new things. In 2021 I started learning
            programming,
            the first language that I started with Python as I found it easy and just to start my programming journey.

        </p>

        <p>After starting my journey with Python, I found front end web dev is the path to go futher. So I did learning
            basics of the HTML and CSS, also tried to build some simple pages including to clone my college page,
            however I failed in it as it was just starting.</p>

        <p>But didn't stop there, I continued learning web dev. Then there were my exams of SYBcom. After long break, I
            learning litte bit of Android Dev with Java.
            Build some simple project by following a tutorial from the same course that I took.
        </p>

        <p>In this year (2022) I am just focusing on front end web dev. Now I have made 2-3 project by myself which
            includes HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. Currently(August 2022) I am learning Bootstrap CSS framework and
            already build couple of projects with it by following YouTube tutorials.</p>
